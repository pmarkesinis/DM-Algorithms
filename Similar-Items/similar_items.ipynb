    "\n",
    "As you learned during the lecture, shingling allows us to assess the similarity between two documents which finds its uses, for example, in plagiarism detection. A k-shingle refers to any sequence of k characters that appears in the original document. That way, if two documents are similar they will also contain similar k-shingles. The value of k will depend on the case but, ideally, we want to make sure that the probability of encountering any single k-shingle is relatively low. In this exercise you will implement a set of functions which will allow us to compare the similarity of two arbitrary strings."
